# PieRat-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the Tic Tac Toe Project I'm building for Free Code Camp
The index.html file the index.js inside the js folder and the style.css inside the css folder on this main page of the master are the correct and needed files...simply open the index.html in your brosweerr to see the game working. This game is completely functional with a basic ai algorithm that is simple to beat.
